# Linux Installation Guide
This guide is basicly a installation guide for enviroumental applications that are needed for the tasks that are going to happen. 

But for now only a at least partly finished release can be made for the [EndeavourOS/Arch](./App/EndeavourOS%20(Arch)/README.md) guide. So Debian based systems have to wait for now at least.
